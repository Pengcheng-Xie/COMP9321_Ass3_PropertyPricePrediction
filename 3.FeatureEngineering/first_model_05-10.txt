pppXXX.ipynb is the Property Price Prediction program
At this moment, Iâ€™ve finished the first baseline.

### These are the main tasks I've done in this file
1. Doing feature engineering
2. Making train and test datasets
3. Building model (XGBoost)
4. Test the Model (the score function is *mean_squared_error*). 


### TODO: 
Building other models such as Lasso regression, Ridge regression, SVR and so on so forth.

Then do stacking and improving the test score.

Also can redo data cleaning and feature engineering to elevate the performance of the model.
