This is just a general guides for using git repo to teamwork, it doesn't contain  much details on command of git, you can search and learn them.

## Basic Command

To operate git, there are some basic command
 
 - Local repo control: `git add`, `git commit`, `git checkout`
 - Status check: `git log`, `git status`
 - Remote repo control: `git remote`, `git push`, `git pull`

 and I will check and merge your request.
 
 ### Update local repo
 
There is another important thing you need to do, update your local repo to the latest one as same as the repo your forked before `git push` for avoiding merge conflict.

You can use 

 - `git remote add upstream https://github.com//username_you_forked//repo_your_fork.git` add remote connection
 - `git fetch upstream master` get latest repo
 - `git checkout master` switch to master branch
 - `git merge upstream/master` merge latest one into your local repo

By the way, the last three steps can be replaced by `git pull upstream master`, but it is not safe.
